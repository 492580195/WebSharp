# Example Hello World

## Your First `Electron Dotnet` Application

This document will take you through creating your first `Electron Dotnet` application for VS Code ("Hello World") and will explain the basic `Electron` integration points to add C# code and Plugins to your `Electron` application.

In this walkthrough, you'll add a C# and a new Plugin to an Electron application which will display a simple "Hello" message from them both. Later in the walkthrough, you'll see how we can debug the different `Electron` processes, Main and Renderer.

## Prerequisites
You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and available in your $PATH.
   * Plugins require [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) installed and available in your $PATH.
      
      > :bulb: Windows will need both the x86 and x64 bit versions installed and [available in your $PATH](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/tree/master/electron-dotnet#setting-mono-path).
   * `electron-dotnet` needs to be built.  The easiest way is to use the provided `make` files available in the WebSharp base directory.  
   
      * [Windows Prerequisites](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/tree/master/electron-dotnet#building-on-windows)
   
     ``` bash
     # Windows Visual Studio 2015 Command Line Prompt 
     nmake /f Makefile.win buildRelease
     ```

      * [Mac Prerequisites](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/tree/master/electron-dotnet#building-on-osx)
     ``` bash
     # Mac OSX terminal with XCode tools available for build.
     make setup  # only needs to be run the first time
     make build
     ```
     
## Getting Started      
  * Install [.NET Core.](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
  * Install the [C# extension from the VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp).

## Generate a `Electron Dotnet` Application
The simplest way to add a new `Electron DotNet` application for VS Code consumption is through adding a project. A project will have all the boot strap files available to run the `Electron` application.  For more details you can look at the [Electron Quick Start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

We have written a Yeoman generator to help get you started. Install Yeoman and the Yeoman Electron Dotnet generator that provides different templates for creating new applications:

``` bash
npm install -g yo path-to-WebSharp-directory\Tools\generator-electron-dotnet
yo electron-dotnet
```
You will be presented with three different project types. For this example, we will pick `Node.js .NET Scripting`.

Once the type of application project is selected the generator will present you with a series of questions so that the generator can generate the application for you.  Fill in the answers as shown in the following screen shot.

![The electron-dotnet generator questions](./screenshots/yogen-mac-ask.PNG)

Hit enter to start generating the application structure.

![The electron-dotnet generator install](./screenshots/yogen-mac-install.PNG)

This will install the dependencies automatically and when done you will have the application generated.

## The Structure of an application
After running, the generated application should have the following structure:

```
.
|--- .eslintrc.json
|--- .gitignore
|--- .vscode                           // VS Code integration
     |--- launch.json                  // Launch Configurations
     |--- settings.json
|--- .vscodeignore
|--- electron-dotnet-quickstart.md
|--- index.html                       // Html to be displayed in the app window
|--- jsconfig.json
|--- main.js                          // Defines the electron main process
|--- node_modules
     |--- All the node files used to run the electron application
|--- package.json                     // Various project metadata
|--- README.md
|--- renderer.js                      // Required in index.html and executed in the renderer process for that window 
|--- src                              // sources
     |--- scriptingjs.js              // javascript code implementation

```

Let's go through the purpose of some of these files and explain what they do:

### The application manifest: package.json
The format of `package.json` is exactly the same as that of [Node’s modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json), and the script specified by the `main` field is the startup script of your app, which will run the main process.

* It serves as documentation for what packages your project depends on.
* It allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project can use using [semantic versioning rules](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning).
* Makes your build reproducable which means that its way easier to share with other developers.

``` json
{
    "name": "scriptingjs",
    "displayName": "ScriptingJS",
    "description": "Example of scripting node.js from Electron",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "publisher": "Xamarin",
    "main": "main.js",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "electron ."
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "electron": "^1.4.0"
    }
}
```

As you can see above the information that was filled in from the template questions has been placed in this file.

Electron is listed as one of the devDependencies and should have been installed when the template was created.  

A `start` script has already been defined in the `scripts` section that can easily be run as the target of a `npm run` command and is the default target for `npm start`.  In this case since we are creating an Electron application is set to run `electron .`.

### Start up script of our app: main.js

The `main.js` should create windows and handle system events.

``` js
// app is the Module to control application life.
// BrowserWindow is the Module to create native browser window.
const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron')

// Keep a global reference of the window object, if you don't, the window will
// be closed automatically when the JavaScript object is garbage collected.
var mainWindow = null;

function createWindow () {
  // Create the browser window.
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({width: 600, height: 400})

  // and load the index.html of the app.
  mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/index.html`)

  // Open the DevTools.
  //mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools()

  // Emitted when the window is closed.
  mainWindow.on('closed', function () {
    // Dereference the window object, usually you would store windows
    // in an array if your app supports multi windows, this is the time
    // when you should delete the corresponding element.
    mainWindow = null
  })
}

// This method will be called when Electron has finished
// initialization and is ready to create browser windows.
// Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs.
app.on('ready', createWindow)

// Quit when all windows are closed.
app.on('window-all-closed', function () {
  // On OS X it is common for applications and their menu bar
  // to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit()
  }
})

app.on('activate', function () {
  // On OS X it's common to re-create a window in the app when the
  // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open.
  if (mainWindow === null) {
    createWindow()
  }
})

// In this file you can include the rest of your app's specific main process
// code. You can also put them in separate files and require them here.

```

### Showing Information: index.html
The web page you want to show is defined in the static html file `index.html`.  This file is loaded from the `main.js` file referenced above in the `createWindow()` method.

``` js
 // and load the index.html of the app.
  mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/index.html`)
```

The static html file is just a normal file containing html elements that will be displayed in Electron's browser page.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>ScriptingJS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>ScriptingJS</h1>
    <!-- All of the Node.js APIs are available in this renderer process. -->
    We are using node <script>document.write(process.versions.node)</script>,
    Chromium <script>document.write(process.versions.chrome)</script>,
    and Electron <script>document.write(process.versions.electron)</script>.
  </body>

  <script>
    // You can also require other files to run in this process
    require('./renderer.js')
  </script>
</html>

```

### Renderer Process: renderer.js

Since Electron uses Chromium for displaying web pages, Chromium’s multi-process architecture is also used. Each web page in Electron runs in its own process, which is called the renderer process.

In normal browsers, web pages usually run in a sandboxed environment and are not allowed access to native resources. Electron users, however, have the power to use Node.js APIs in web pages allowing lower level operating system interactions.

``` js
// This file is required by the index.html file and will
// be executed in the renderer process for that window.
// All of the Node.js APIs are available in this process.
var hello = require("./src/scriptingjs.js");

hello.sayHello();
```

We require the electron-dotnet.js generated file `"./src/scriptingjs.js"` which is the .NET and Node.js in-process implementation. To print out the `Hello` message we will execute the exported method from that file `sayHello` which displays the message to the console.

When we get to debugging you will see why it is broken up this way.

> :bulb: We will not be going into the differences of Electron's Main and Renderer processes but for more informaiton you can start [here](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/#differences-between-main-process-and-renderer-process) 


### Generated Code

The generated application's code is in the `src` directory.  Depending on the project template selected there is an implementation of each type of application integration point generated.  When we selected the `electron-dotnet.js: .NET and Node.js in-process with PepperPlugin` we will have a total of two src files:

``` bash
.
|--- src                              // sources
     |--- scripting.js                // javascript code implementation
```
#### electron-dotnet.js: .NET and Node.js in-process implementation: scriptingjs.js

``` js
var dotnet = require('electron-dotnet');

var hello = dotnet.func('async (input) => { return ".NET welcomes " + input.ToString(); }');

//Make method externaly visible this will be referenced in the renderer.js file
exports.sayHello = arg => {
	hello('Electron', function (error, result) {
		if (error) throw error;
		console.log(result);
	});
}
```

The first two lines of the file enables scripting C# from a Node.js and then creates a C# `hello` function for us.

For more detailed information about scripting C# from a Node.js process please reference the [How to: integrate C# code into Node.js code](
https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/tree/master/electron-dotnet#how-to-integrate-c-code-into-nodejs-code
) section of the documentation.

What we do need to point out is the code:

``` js
//Make method externaly visible this will be referenced in the renderer.js file
exports.sayHello = arg => {
	hello('Electron', function (error, result) {
		if (error) throw error;
		console.log(result);
	});
}
``` 

We will be referencing this code from Electron's Renderer process which can be found in the [`renderer.js` file mentioned above](#renderer-process-rendererjs). To do this we will export a function called `sayHello` so that it can be referenced in other processes.

At the bottom of our [index.html](#showing-information-indexhtml) we require `renderer.js` which loads this file into Electrons's [Renderer](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/#renderer-process) process.  

``` js
  <script>
    // You can also require other files to run in this process
    require('./renderer.js')
  </script>
```

### Miscellaneous files
* .vscode/launch.json - [Defines Debugger launching targets](./vsc-debug.md). 
* .vscode/settings.json - Place your settings in this file to overwrite default and user settings, by default specifies the typescript server. If you are receiving a *TypeScript tsserver error* you can install this into your project's local node_modules by exectuing `npm i typescript`.
* .gitignore - Tells Git version control which patterns to ignore.
* README.md - README file describing your application.
* electron-dotnet-quickstart.md - A Quick Start guide for you.
* .eslintrc.json - Configuring ESLint

## Running the application

To run the application we will need to install 'electron-dotnet' module which provides all of the ```Node.js``` implemenation for running within ```Electron```.

> :bulb: This project dependency will be automatic in the future once the project workflow has been defined and will be installed with the template in the future.

But right now we will have to do this install manually from the command line.

``` bash
# Windows
scriptingjs> npm install path-to-WebSharp\electron-dotnet   
scriptingjs> npm start 
```

> :bulb: Windows users need to make sure that mono is [available in their $PATH](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/tree/master/electron-dotnet#setting-mono-path).  If not then a runtime error is generated.


``` bash
# Mac OSX
scriptingjs$ npm install path-to-WebSharp/electron-dotnet   
scriptingjs$ npm start 
```

## Hello World !!!

You should be presented with the following screen:

![ScriptingJS application](./screenshots/scriptingjs.png)

The ScriptingJS program writes output to the Console.  To see this you can select `View` -> `Toggle Developer Tools` which will show the console of the Developer Tools.

## Debugging

You can now move on to [Debugging](./vsc-debug.md) your `Electron` application.
