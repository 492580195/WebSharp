Getting Started
---------------

1. Install node.js - https://nodejs.org/
2. From a command prompt ```> npm install --arch=ia32 electron-prebuilt -g```.  This will install the 32 bit electron prebuilt which is required for now.  Notice the ```-g``` parameter which tells npm to install electron globally.
